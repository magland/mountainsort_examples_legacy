NodeJS installation
===================

NodeJS is required for various components of MountainLab. If you are on Ubuntu, you can do the following prior to MountainLab compilation:

.. code :: bash
	
	sudo apt-get install nodejs npm nodejs-legacy

Otherwise, visit the `NodeJS home page <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_

Note: depending on how nodejs is named on your system, you may need to do the following (or something like it) so that "nodejs" is a recognized command:

.. code :: bash
	
	sudo  ln -s /usr/bin/node /usr/bin/nodejs
